# Inverted_Search

**Abstract:**

An Inverted Index is an index data structure storing content such as words or numbers, to its location in a database file, or in a document or a set of documents. The main purpose of this project is to allow fast text searches, at a cost of increased processing when a document is added to the database. By using Hash Algorithms we have to create the database and the time complexity is less compared to forward indexing. The list is arranged in sorted order of words. This will help to search the words easily in the list and produce the information about the documents in which they are present. 

**Requirements:**
1. Indexing
2. Querying

**Pre-requisite:**
1. Hashing
2. Single linked list
3. File Handling
